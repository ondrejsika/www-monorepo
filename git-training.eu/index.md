## About the training

I think, the workshop is the best way how to learn something now. I beleve, the practical experience is the best you can learn, becouse every my trainings are workshops. Public workshops are located in meeting rooms of some local coworking spaces and I also do inhose workshops for companies. After training, you get an participation certificate.

Couse is focused to software developer who don't know Git. If you have used some other versioning tool like SVN, it is an advantige, not necessity.
